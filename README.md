// $nu - closely refer to nushells functions, structures & so on. if similar logic exists in try to adopt it as close to nushels behaviour.
//
// $c - holds the underlying/invisible sprecial variables like $in, $it or maybe any context data?
// the 'c' in my head stands for context or caret. as it will both hold our stuff aswell as always follow/control the position and direction of a process.
// ```js
// instdead of `left -> | -> right` piping direction. we'll do
`top'

'down`
// maybe we should just try a couple of different things and see if we can focus on actually transpiling ts_script to nuscript


// lets give it a try, first nu:
'http get htt


// ```
// [ eg: $c.in]


const get_readme = (repo) => https://raw.githubusercontent.com/($repo)/main/README.md ;

  get_readme('akinsho/toggleterm.nvim') ;
  
  $nu.lines ;
  
  $nu.each((ln) => {
  
})


// ----

// nu-script

'akinsho/toggleterm.nvim' $"http://akinsho/toggleterm.nvim/($in).md/main/readme.md" | http get $in |
  lines | each { |ln| $"--##($ln)" } | ast-grep --##```$$$--##``` | each { |m| str replace "--##" "    " |  } 

// the above pipe should give us an array where every row that is not part of a code snippet is 
// prepended with --## (-- comment string in lua) as well as extra indent @ the snippets
// which should make it very easy to mark with tree-sitter for i.e folding. how would a ts pipe look?

// ts-script . note: the $c object doesn't meed to be visible, I'll elaborate soon.
// also the '$nu' object simply hold references to nu's logic.

// and we should have an identical return here.
// THOOOUGH .. it doesn't seem to be valid js from a to z so are we meant to Jit every pipe-step into nuon and back?
// weeeell .. here's where the 'offside buffer comes in, the 'invisible' $c I meantioned earlier.
// it simply follows us around, thus context/caret are both not incorrect names here. e.g:

// the data-struct is a basic array of expressions
// $c runs each line as a function, and stores the result in its 'in' property (
// the rest is only made better! if we store as much data as we are able. passing on the $in prop as the pipe-step result,
// we get the ability to time travel!!! and even branch out basically indefinetely ðŸ˜¬
